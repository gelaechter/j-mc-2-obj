To add additional blocks, such as those from mods, it is recomended to create a new file with
the same structure as this one and name it in the format blocks-{modid}.conf
jmc2obj will search for files with the pattern blocks-*.conf and load them after this file.

materials for the default (cube) model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		 all_sides
	or top_and_bottom, sides
	or top, sides, bottom
	or top, front, back, left, right, bottom
		(top, north, south, west, east, bottom)

occlusion
~~~~~~~~~
	full        - adj. faces are never drawn (default)
	none        - adj. faces are always drawn
	transparent - adj. faces are not drawn if they have the same block id
	bottom      - the top face of the block below is not drawn
	custom      - special occlusion rules in model
	volume      - occlusion for a transparent volume; similar to transparent, but also adds faces on boundaries with other block types 

waterlogged
~~~~~~~~~~~
		true    - always show as waterlogged
		false   - default behaviour
some blocks are 'waterlogged' in game but do not save this in their blockstate
set waterlogged to true to make the block act waterlogged when this tag is missing.
